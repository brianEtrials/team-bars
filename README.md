### Info for use cases testing:

- Credentials for login buyer: username:testbuyer, password:test
- Credentials for login seller: username:testseller, password:test
- Credentials for login admin: username:admin, password:admin24 (login inside 'Sign in' page)
- Item Name should always be unique. If an item is added and another item with the same name already exists, a pop-up window will display the message 'Item added successfully,' but the item will not appear in the review items table.
- Price Range: enter i.e. '1 to 10' in the search field.
- When a buyer purchases an item, they are redirected to the home page. If they place a bid, they remain on the same page but cannot bid again to outbid themselves.
- When an item is purchased using the Buy Now option, the transaction is completed, and no other buyers can purchase it, even if the end date has not yet passed.
